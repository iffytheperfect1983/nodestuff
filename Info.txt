- In order to remove a package, use npm rm package-name
- for example: npm rm body-parser
- then remove package-lock.json, then also delte node_modules folder
- do a fresh npm install, and it'll remove the traces of body-parser
- can modify package .json to include "dev": "nodemon server.js" and to start it, we can run npm run dev
- if want to install not globally, we can do npm install nodemon --save-dev, and this will create dev dependency in package.json
